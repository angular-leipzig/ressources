        speaker: "Ajit Kumar Singh"
        speakerTwitter: "ajitsonlion"
        abstract: "In the Part 1: Introduction we learned about PWAs and using service workers to improve user experience progressively. One of the ways service workers help us improve that experience is by enabling us to show some notifications to user called , Push Notifications.
        We will have a look at basics of how push notifications work and what we need to do in our Angular app to get them working.

        This talk will be built on top of the PWA and Service Worker fundamentals we learned in November.
        However I will try my best to keep the content self sufficient."
