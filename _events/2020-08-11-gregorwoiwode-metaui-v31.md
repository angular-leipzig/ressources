        speaker: "Gregor Woiwode"

        abstract: "Most user interfaces that are written with a javascript framework are a mechanical application of (unstated) rules. Rules that are often rooted in domain object data models. In this talk we are going to explore a way for you to leverage that data model and the meta data associated with it, to scaffold your markup for you.

        We will explore a world of declarative user interfaces and how to build applications faster, with less code.

        When you leave this session you will have a deeper understanding of meta driven design as a whole and how to use a new framework called MetaUI with your existing toolset."
        speakerBio: "Gregor is the CTO of co-IT.eu GmbH and a Google Developer Expert for Angular. He loves building tools that enable developers to be more productive. In his role as Speaker, Trainer and Consultant he teaches techniques to continuously improve the architectural design of Angular applications.
