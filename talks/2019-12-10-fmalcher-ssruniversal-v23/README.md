## Server-Side Rendering (SSR) with Angular Universal

**Speaker:** Ferdinand Malcher

Single page applications in their pure form have one conceptual problem: the JavaScript code runs in one single “empty” HTML page. Search engines like the Google Bot don’t like to render JavaScript and see nothing but a blank page. SEO becomes almost impossible! What is more, before the user can interact with our app, the code must be downloaded and rendered. This extends loading time and makes users frustrated.

In this talk, Angular book author and Google Developer Expert Ferdinand Malcher will introduce you to the concepts and ideas of server-side rendering and pre-rendering with Angular. We will talk about possible solutions and go through specific examples with Angular. The extensive tooling around “Angular Universal” greatly helps us on our way. You will learn how the Angular server platform works and how you can set up a server-rendered application on your own.
