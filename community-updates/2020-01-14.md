## ℹ️ News

### Scully

There's a new community project called Scully.io.
It's a Angular Static Site Generator (JAMStack) that prerenders your app to create static HTML files from the dynamic Angular application. It's been a hot topic the last weeks, so take a look at it.

### Angular 9

Angular 9 is not released yet... it's to be expected for the next weeks.
