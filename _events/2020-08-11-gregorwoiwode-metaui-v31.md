        abstract: "Most user interfaces that are written with a javascript framework are a mechanical application of (unstated) rules. Rules that are often rooted in domain object data models. In this talk we are going to explore a way for you to leverage that data model and the meta data associated with it, to scaffold your markup for you.

        We will explore a world of declarative user interfaces and how to build applications faster, with less code.

        When you leave this session you will have a deeper understanding of meta driven design as a whole and how to use a new framework called MetaUI with your existing toolset."
