        speakerTwitter: "SantoshYadavDev"
        abstract: "Angular made the Angular CLI builders API public – in this talk we will explore why it was required and how to use it. We will learn how to create our own builder and make complicated things easier for us. We will explore the API in depth and learn a lot about how the CLI works internally. Of course, I will also show you the most popular builders that will make your daily work easier and showcase you a some of the lesser-known gems that might be added to the Angular CLI as a command in the future. Angular CLI is a powerful tool to work with Angular, and while using it, We often don't leverage the API's that make it so powerful, like Schematics and Builders. With the first one, we can extend/modify the workspace, The latter allows us to us to create our own commands. Join me to learn about these powerful APIs and how to use them."
